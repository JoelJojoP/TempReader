## Overview:
The ATMega328P microcontroller chip used in development boards like Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano have an internal temperature sensor wired to the 8th channel of the inbuilt Analog to digital convertor (ADC) on the chip.

This library enables the user to obtain measurements from the internal temperature sensor of the chip using a single function, ```ReadTemp()```. The value returned is in Â°C.

## Bugs:

- Temperature readings are wrong when using ```analogRead()``` function.
